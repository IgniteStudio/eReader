	<h1 id="h1">Python</h1>
	<p class="des">Python is a high level interpreted language with very easy
	syntax that uses indentation instead of semi-colons.  Since it was invented 
	in 1997, it	has become the goto language of data scientists today.  It is also 
	used in conjunction with Django/Flask to make full stack web apps.<br><br>
	
	Because of its ease of use and simple expressive syntax, Python makes it 
	easy to learn how to code.  It is the first programming language I 
	learned!<br><br>
	
	The only drawbacks of Python is its speed and inability to handle very 
	large code.</p><br>
