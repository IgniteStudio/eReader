	<h1 class="blink">JAVA</h1>
	<p class="des">This is all about Java.  The most ubiquitous programming language in the
	world!<br><br>
	
	Regardless of how old, verbose or tough to learn this language is, it 
	remains the foundational language for most software out there.  It is 
	heavily used in enterprise environments, android development, game dev,
	and back end development.<br><br>
	
	
	It is also the most in demand skill in the job market today.  Well beyond 
	any other language. (see stats below)<br><br><!-- insert hyperlink to stats
	page or embedded image. -->
	It is a purely object oriented language that heavily borrows from C++ and C.  
	Not to be confused with or equated to JavaScript, which is a much lighter,
	and front end based programming language for the web.<br><br>
	I am currently enrolled in a college program that heavily focuses on 
	Java, so I will provide more input on my personal experience with these
	ebooks.
