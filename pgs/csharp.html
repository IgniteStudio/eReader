	<h1 class="blink">C#</h1>
	<p class="des">
	C# is the latest version of the C languages.  It takes from C++ and improves
	on it.  When Java emerged, it's JVM attracted so many customers, it became
	the defacto programming language for enterprise software.  To counter the 
	competition, C# was created and in many ways is almost identical to Java.
	Today, its main use is in the gaming industry where it is coupled with
	Unity to create video games.<br>
	
	It is also used to create web services for the .NET Framework.  The only 
	drawback is it only works for Microsoft platforms and operating systems.
