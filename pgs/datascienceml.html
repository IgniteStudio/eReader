	<p>Data Science is the field of study that deals with data manipulation,
	visualization and analysis.  It is also the stepping stone into machine
	learning which further leads to deep learning and artificial intelligence.
	<br>
	The reason I added this page to the site is because of how lucrative and in
	demand this field is.  
	<br>
	Dataquest is a great place to start getting your feet wet and Anaconda is 
	a great, if not one of the best, free datascience package that uses the 
	Python language.  It comes with all the libraries you need and IDE's for
	Python, R, and other languages.
	<br>
	Python is the most used language for datascience and I advise you to spend 
	a little bit of time understanding its very easy and expressive syntax.
