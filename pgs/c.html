	<p class="des">This page is all about the low level procedural language C.  
	This language paved the way for C++ and C#.  It is low level because it 
	gives direct access to the hardware of the computer, allowing the programmer
	to optimize and allocate memory more precisely.  It is not a language on 
	my priority list right now, but will eventually learn after securing
	myself with Java.
	
	The links here are preliminary and unreviewed until I engage the language.  
	I will, however, attempt a quick review once time permits.
